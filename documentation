Terraform AWS:

IAM :

(access for humans)--users and groups
IAM policy defined in json format.
User: individual. 
Groups: Collection of users.

(access for other services)
resources in aws do not have any permissions to interact with other services like users, they need to grant acccess specifically.
we cannot attach a iam policy to a service directly., for service interaction we need to create a role.
IAM ROLE securely,grants access for the service interaction.

to the iam role, we can attach the same iam policy.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
other uses of roles:
1)providing access to iam user belonging to other AWS ACCOUNT.
2)providing access to applications to interact with services in AWS.
3)providing access to user outside aws (active directory)
